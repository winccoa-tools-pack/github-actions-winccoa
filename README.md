# github-actions-winccoa

Reusable GitHub Actions for WinCC OA projects.

This repository is structured as a multi-action repository. Each action lives in its own subdirectory under `actions/` and is published from the same repository tag.

## Why one repository

For an expected set of 20-25 actions, one repository is the better default:

- lower maintenance overhead for branching, rulesets, CI, security, and release automation
- one place for shared contribution guidelines and examples
- easier discovery for consumers looking for WinCC OA automation
- consistent version tags across related actions

Use separate repositories only when an action needs one of these:

- independent ownership or permissions
- a very different runtime or toolchain
- a separate release cadence with breaking changes unrelated to the rest
- a security boundary that should not share CI or release flows

## Available actions

### winccoa-build-docs

Builds WinCC OA help documentation in a container and extracts Doxygen
warnings for PR reporting or quality gates.

```yaml
- id: docs
  uses: winccoa-tools-pack/github-actions-winccoa/actions/winccoa-build-docs@main
  with:
    path: src/Squirt
    winccoa-version: '3.21'
    docker-image: ghcr.io/winccoa-tools-pack/winccoa:v3.21.3-debian12-all
    max-warning-count: '0'
```

## Runtime and compatibility

- Actions in this repository are intended for Linux environments.
- The current validation baseline is Debian-based Docker images with WinCC OA 3.21.
- Compatibility is expected for WinCC OA 3.21 patch versions and WinCC OA 3.22.
- Legacy WinCC OA 3.20 may work, but should be treated as best-effort and validated per project.

### syntax-check

Runs WinCC OA syntax validation inside a Docker image.

```yaml
- uses: winccoa-tools-pack/github-actions-winccoa/actions/syntax-check@v1
  with:
    path: .
    winccoa-version: '3.21'
    docker-image: ghcr.io/winccoa-tools-pack/winccoa:latest
```

### project-metadata

Normalizes project and config paths for downstream workflow steps.

```yaml
- id: metadata
  uses: winccoa-tools-pack/github-actions-winccoa/actions/project-metadata@v1
  with:
    path: demo-oa-repo

- run: echo "Config is ${{ steps.metadata.outputs.config-path }}"
```

## Release model

- tag the repository with full versions such as `v1.2.0`
- move the major tag such as `v1` after compatible releases
- keep breaking changes grouped into a new major tag

That model is simple and works well until one action needs its own release lifecycle. If that happens, split only that action into its own repository.

## Development

```powershell
npm install
npm run validate
npm run list:actions
```
